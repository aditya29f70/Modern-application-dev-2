## Communication bw client - server /server-server

## light weight API's

-> to api often use to sent a good amount of data to server;; light weight mean will sent to server with not high data eg {'data': 'aditya'}

## 1. webhooks --> also called -> /webcallback /reverse API / Push API

-> server-to-server communication and event driven (what it means: something will happens only when that envet will be happend)

eg: we push some code to --> (github)(has github sever) --> now it do now thing just call a html url (route) let (mail/webhook-endpoint) (since this url only telling to sent email , it doesn't have any data so we can this api to light weight .) --> get/post --> now this url is triggerd which send mail to 10 connected people

- or here we only notifying through one server to another to sent email to 10 person

- webhook has to part in it

1. webhook sender (this is sending the request from one server to another) --> if using node.js server then we can directly do this using **fetch** fn

2. webhook reciever ;; normal flask api reciever

- webhook (it server to server communication) is generally get request , it can be post request. that why says push api also (it is not like client server thing where client want some info it sent request to server and server has to sent info regarding that request)

## 2. websockets

### two way / bidirectional communication

-> meaning client contineously sending data to server and sever also contineously sending data to client

eg: games , audio calls, live chat etc..

--> here also first request must be from client side;; after that websockets communication start

- note: websockets does not use **HTTP** (it is made for one way communication) there some othere protocall

- for that we have **flask-io**

## 3. push notifications

-> you as a client recieving some kind of notification from the server (eg whatsup notification, swiggy notif.. etc)

-> so server can't sent notification directly ; for that first some kind of communication mush be happend first so this is happend (js runtime present in background) that program handle this server request when this request has some kind of infomation then this runtime sends you notification

eg;; zamato app in your phone i can't be ron all the time but it has (some pease of code) running in the background that communicates with server and when the server sends some request back then it will sent a notification in my phone

- this connection bw runtime and server can be server-sent-event or interval polling

- this program which is working in the background is called **service worker** ;; it is js code running in the background

## 4. polling

-> we have **settimeinterval** through that we can send request to the server for data without alway telling for it.

-> in long-polling we sent request to server , server keep this request active untill any tell is not updated on the server after will sent the response

## 5. pub / sub

--> public and subscribe
-> someone is publishing some information and someone is subscribing it
--> means there would be one server and multiple clients and clients will send subscribe request to server after that those has connected with server now there me be server connect with (server send request) SSE so after that subscribe request they will directly get all reponse from server

## 6. Server sent events

- in general client sent request to server for some kind of data then after server sends that data back (for this cliend always has to sent request);;
- but what if server automatically send data to client when ever it will be updated without requesting.

- this is called server sents evnet (SSE) (bz http reqeust is stateless intial server don't know who you are)

- bassically client first requset to server (evnet stream , that send me data utill i don't close the page) now server will continueously send data(through http request) without any request called SSE

- note:: first request must be made by client

###### now try to implement these things through code
## you can see SSE you to you dev tool > network you will see **stream**
