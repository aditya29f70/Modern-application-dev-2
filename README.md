#Modern application develpment 2 theory work


* we will see what is deff bettween python and js

1. why js is created ?
-> mostly for frontend


js language;
interpreted -> line by line, opposite: compiled -> whole code

weakly typed (forgiving in type convers) like if initilaly we say that a= 10 (int ) then after if i tell that a='ram' (str) so it will allow me that i can do this ->    vs opposite->  strongly typed ( can't change the type of varible)

diff

dynamically typed(eg, python, js) -> (we don't have to explicitly menstion the type of data which will be stored in  variable before initilise ) eg. a=10,  vs opposite: static typed -> have to explicitly menstion the type of data which is gone to put in varibale eg. (in jave) int a=10



## some js has some jargons (lot ambiguity) eg

in python
x= 10, y= '60'
print(x+y) --> error

but in js
console.log(x+y) --> 1060 <-- int

lly if
in js

console.log(x*y) -> 600 <-- int

open the devtool --> shortcut -> ctrl + shift+ i

or manullay go to selting on browser -> more tools -> dev tool

note: each line of code terminate with help of -> ';'
