#Modern application develpment 2 theory work

- js is used mostly for frontend

- all the browser already has tools required to run js
- Node.js another envirement where you can run your js or ( run js on machine(node.js))

#and both are called runtimes( a env where js can run)

- inside the runtimes we have **engine**(process code line by line) here we don't have **URL**, but in runtime env we have URL that what we try to say that runtime has extra feature also
  --> so **console.log()** --> is api's we help us to print thing on console
  --> lly we have **document obj** which allows us to access the web page where the browser is currently running -> this only available in the browser env -> it is not available in the node.js env

#also we have diff engine to js script run --> tipically we use v8 -> chrome use this engine, node.js, spidermonkey, firefox

#######js language

- interpreted -> exicute line by line ;;; oposite of interpreted(compiled) -> whole code
- weakly typed;
- opposite ; strong-typed;

**JIT** -> just in time compilatioin <--js
