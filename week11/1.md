# Introduction to Flask Caching --> i can do something from client side --> some data is called multiple times we store that data in certain time line may be 10sec or 20 sec 

* try to understand --> how data can be cached and can be stored somewhere so that we don't have to fetch multiple time from our database

* this what we will be discussing

* here we want datastore to be redis
* and try to understand is there any thing similar like sqlalchemy on redis


* cache is worked on static portion only dynamic can't 

* install `pip install flask flask-caching redis`

* `sudo apt install redis-server`

* `redis-server`

* `redis-cli` --> give you server code ;; at which server it is running

* to know, is redis is running or not just go `redis-cli ping` --> give you PONG --> means it is running , 

* to stop running use --> graceful shutdown (preferred) --> `redis-cli shutdown`
* `sudo systemctl stop redis`
* `sudo systemctl status redis` # check status

* `sudo service redis-server start`


## we will be studing mostly about two thing in cache
1. @cache.cached – Cache full route responses.
2. @cache.memoize – Cache function results based on

* in cache.cached we have two attribute 
1. timeout=30,
2. key_prefix

* since here cache using redis to store data and redis store data has key-value pair so in cache we have to provide key_prefix ;; not need to value ;if we don't value this ,automatically something 'view..' key is made
